A Python implementation of a RationalNumber class supporting arithmetic operations and float handling.
=======
# RationalNumber Class

This repository contains a Python implementation of a `RationalNumber` class that supports rational number operations, simplifying fractions, and working with integers and floating-point numbers. It is designed for ease of use and mathematical accuracy.

## Features

- Supports arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Automatically simplifies fractions to their lowest terms.
- Converts integers and floating-point numbers to rational numbers internally.
- Prevents invalid operations like division by zero.
- Provides string, integer, and float representations of rational numbers.

## Installation

To use this class in your project, simply clone this repository and import the `RationalNumber` class:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rational-number-class.git
